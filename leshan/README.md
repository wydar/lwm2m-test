[Eclipse Leshanâ„¢](https://eclipse.org/leshan) is an OMA Lightweight M2M server and client Java implementation.

[What is OMA LWM2M ?](https://omaspecworks.org/what-is-oma-specworks/iot/lightweight-m2m-lwm2m/)  
[Object and Resource Registry](http://www.openmobilealliance.org/wp/OMNA/LwM2M/LwM2MRegistry.html).  

Leshan provides libraries which help people to develop their own Lightweight M2M server and client.  
The project also provides a client, a server and a bootstrap server demonstration as an example of the Leshan API and for testing purpose.

You can try live our servers demos instances:

* The **lwm2m server** at https://leshan.eclipseprojects.io/  
   _(coap://leshan.eclipseprojects.io:5683  and coaps://leshan.eclipseprojects.io:5684)_  
* The **bootstrap server** at https://leshan.eclipseprojects.io/bs/  
   _(coap://leshan.eclipseprojects.io:5783  and coaps://leshan.eclipseprojects.io:5784)_

Test Leshan Demos locally
-----------------------
Get and run the last binary of our demo **server** :
```
wget https://ci.eclipse.org/leshan/job/leshan/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/leshan-server-demo.jar
java -jar ./leshan-server-demo.jar
```
Get and run the last binary of our demo **client** :
```
wget https://ci.eclipse.org/leshan/job/leshan/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/leshan-client-demo.jar
java -jar ./leshan-client-demo.jar
```
Get and run the last binary of our **bootstrap** demo server :
```
wget https://ci.eclipse.org/leshan/job/leshan/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/leshan-bsserver-demo.jar
java -jar ./leshan-bsserver-demo.jar
```
:information_source: : _All the demos have a `--help` option._

Compile Leshan & Run Demos
-------------
Get sources :
```bash
#using ssh
git clone git@github.com:eclipse/leshan.git
```
or
```
#using https
git clone https://github.com/eclipse/leshan.git

```

Compile it, by running in leshan root folder :

```
mvn clean install
```

Run demo **server**:
```
java -jar leshan-server-demo/target/leshan-server-demo-*-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar 
```

Connect on Leshan demo UI: http://localhost:8080  
Leshan server Demo provides a very simple UI to get the list of connected clients and interact with clients resources.

Now you can register a LWM2M client by running our **client** demo:
```
java -jar leshan-client-demo/target/leshan-client-demo-*-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar 
```
or trying the [Eclipse Wakaama](http://eclipse.org/wakaama) test client.

You can also try our **bootstrap** demo server:
```
java -jar leshan-bsserver-demo/target/leshan-bsserver-demo-*-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar 
```

Let's start to code !
---------------------
Now you played a bit with our demo, you should start to code your own server or client using our [Getting-started](https://github.com/eclipse/leshan/wiki/Getting-started) guide.
